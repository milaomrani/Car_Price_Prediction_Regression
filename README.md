# Car Price Prediction Regression

## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as year, km driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner details. The project utilizes linear regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `name`: The name of the car.
- `year`: The year the car was manufactured.
- `selling_price`: The selling price of the car.
- `km_driven`: The total kilometers driven by the car.
- `fuel`: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).
- `seller_type`: The type of seller (e.g., Individual, Dealer).
- `transmission`: The type of transmission the car has (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
- `owner`: The number of previous owners of the car.

The dataset is available in the `car_sale.zip` file in the repository.

## Installation
